FCLONE - PAHE Clone Project 2023
---------------------------------------------

Fclone is my personal project that focuses on cloning the appearance of certain web apps and then adjusting them to make them more distinct based on my preferences.

The Fclone project is usually developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project doesnâ€™t include backend programming or computation processes, so you are only able to see the design and appearance.
